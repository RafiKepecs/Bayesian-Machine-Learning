# Bayesian-Machine-Learning

Projects implementing common machine learning algorithms

## Project 1: Conjugate Priors
### Part 1: Estimating Probability of Binomial RV
#### Select Model Parameters
Model parameters a0 and b0 correspond to the prior beta estimation of coin's heads-probability.
N is the number of simulated coin flips, and p is the probability of an individual coin flip showing heads.
#### Generate Coin-Flip Results
Perform N coin flips, using the flip(p) function defined below, returning 1 (heads) with a probability of p.
Record results in binary list "flips", and calculate values of a and b after each flip.
#### Calculations
Calculate the a[n] and b[n] values of the beta distribution after each coin flip
#### Plot Results
Plot the prior and posterior beta distributions of the estimated heads-probability of the coin
#### Create Animation
### Part 2: Estimating the Distribution of a Gaussian RV
#### Estimating Mean of Gaussian With Known Variance
#### Estimating Variance of Gaussian With Known Mean
